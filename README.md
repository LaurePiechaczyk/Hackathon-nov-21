## About 
Welcome to MEET THE .


The website offers the general public the opportunity to attend breast cancer events designed for them.

## Background
Basic science and research can be very intimidating for non-scientists. The vocabulary is very specific and the experiments done in a laboratory are not always understandable to the general public.

Yet medical research is done for patients, with the aim of improving their lives.

So how can we bridge the gap between research and patients and enable better communication?


The aim of this website is to help the general public to better understand breast cancer, basic cancer research and to facilitate communication between researchers and patients, patients' families or anyone interested in the subject.

### Goals

The site is designed to offer the general public the opportunity to attend events specifically designed for them (not for scientists). The aim is to give the general public the desire and opportunity to meet researchers and participate in research-related events. 


For this project, the events were invented because a viable project would first need to recruit the scientists. However, even though the events were invented, they are realistic events based on actual research carried out in the laboratories.
